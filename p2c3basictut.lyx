If you explain a magic trick before it is performed, you risk spoiling the
 enjoyment.
 There will be plenty of time after you work through a few of the tutorials
 to learn what is going on “behind the curtain.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, in the spirit of this adventure we will explain just enough right now
 to allow you to dive in head first… 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Tutorial 1 – Directories and Generators 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will create a single-table application that demonstrates how Hobo constructs
 a nice user interface that includes a built-in login system and basic search
 capability.
 Hobo 1.3 generators are compatible with the new Rails 3 generator API and
 operate quite differently from Hobo 1.0 and Rails 2.x.
 We will explain in more detail below.

Description of development tools.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 You will use three tools to do the work in these tutorials.
 They include: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A shell command prompt to run scripts 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A text editor for you to edit your application files 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A browser to run and test your application 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ordinarily you will have two shell windows or tabs open: one from which
 to run Hobo scripts or operating system commands and one from which to
 run a web server (Mongrel in these tutorials).
 These tutorials are not done with an integrated development environment
 (IDE).

Create a Hobo application directory.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Before you create your first Hobo application, create a directory called
 tutorials.
 This will be the directory where you keep all of your Hobo tutorials.
 Navigate to the tutorials directory using your shell application.
 You should now see the following prompt:
\end_layout

 Also, notice that in the upper right corner of your web page, there is
 a drop down box that lets you automatically login to any of your accounts
 without using the normal login page.
 This speeds up testing permission customizations in development mode.
 In production mode this option disappears.

 It has one-line fields for strings, a set of three combo boxes for dates,
 a one-line field for integers, a check box for boolean field, and a multi-line
 box for text fields.
 Later you will see that Hobo can provide the controls you need for multi-model
 situations.

Rename a database column.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In Tutorial 1, we showed you how to make changes to your database by editing
 the model file.
 You can rename a field and database column in the same way.
 We will try this with the 
\begin_inset Flex Emph

 field.
 Go to your 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 file and rename 
\begin_inset Flex Code

Changing field names.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 There is no need to change the name of a field or column if all you wish
 to do is to change the name of a label in the user interface.
 Hobo provides this as part of its new Internationalization (
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

) module.
 This 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
i18n
\end_layout

\end_inset

 module is very versatile and can be used for providing field/model renaming
 capabilities up to full multi-lingual support for your application.
 The 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 module is comprised of 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\end_layout

\end_inset

 files that reside in the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 directory; if you look in the directory you will see these files: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

For this tutorial we will assume that english (en) was specified as the
 default locale.
 The 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 file contains all the strings that the hobo framework uses, while application
 specific strings are stored in the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
app.en.yml
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file.
 We will modify the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 file to rename a couple of fields in the Contact model.
 When you open the 
\begin_inset Flex Code

The commented 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 code is very useful in understanding how to setup your locale file.
 Our goal is to rename the

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 fields of the Contact model.
 To do this, add the illustrated code to the file:

You will be introduced to a couple of ways of validating data entry fields.
 This is a capability that is derived from what are called Rails helper
 methods.
 There are a couple of enhancements Hobo has made for the most common need.

 Open up the model

 file.
 Add the following code to the “name” field definition 
\end_layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the simplified version that Hobo provides.
 To do this in the “normal” rails way, you would need to add this line after
 the “fields/do” block: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Box Shadowbox
position "t"
hor_pos "c"
has_inner_box 1
inner_pos "t"
use_parbox 0

height_special "totalheight"
status open

\begin_layout LyX-Code
validates_presence_of :name 
\end_layout

(The difference in the two is a matter of taste, but the former seems “DRYer”
 to us.)

\begin_layout Description
Note: This particular validation will only verify that there is no existing
 record with the same field value at the time of validation.
 In a multi-user application, there is still a chance that records could
 be entered nearly at the same time resulting in a duplicate entry.
 The most reliable way to enforce uniqueness is with a database-level constraint.

Tutorial 4 – Permissions 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this tutorial you will learn some elementary aspects of Hobo’s permission
 system by changing what the admin user and users can do.
 Specifically, you will determine whether a user is permitted to view, create,
 edit or delete records in the database.
 Topics Experiment with altering user permissions.
 Naming conventions for database tables, models, controllers and views.
 Tutorial Application: one_table Steps 1.
 Create the Hobo application.
 Create the one_table Hobo application by issuing the following command
 at the command prompt.
 By adding the --setup command line parameter the application will bypass
 the setup wizard and create the application with default settings, Then
 change directory to the subdirectory one_table: 
\backslash
tutorials> hobo new one_table --setup 
\backslash
tutorials> cd one_table 
\backslash
one_table> Recall from Tutorial 1 that this sets up the Hobo directory tree
 and the user model and controller.
 Note: Look at the file 
\backslash
one_table
\backslash
app
\backslash
models
\backslash
user.rb and at the database schema file 
\backslash
one_table
\backslash
db
\backslash
schema.rb.
 There are more fields in the users table than in the user model.
 This is because Hobo creates several user model fields for you automatically.
 This will not be the case for models you create.
 3.
 Start the web server.
 Open a new command prompt and navigate to the 
\backslash
tutorials
\backslash
one_table directory.
 Fire up your web server by issuing the following command.
 
\backslash
one_table> rails server 4.
 Initiate the web application.
 Enter the local URL for the application in your browser’s URL window: http://lo
calhost:3000/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should now see the following displayed on your browser.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 Create user accounts.
 You will need a couple of accounts to exercise the functions of the One
 Table application.
 Let’s do this now like you did in Tutorial 1.
 Click Register Administrator to create the administrator account.
 We refer to this account as the admin account.
 Logout and create a second account.
 We will refer to this second account as the user account in the following
 tutorials.
 By default, the user account does not have administrative privileges.
 Later in the tutorial, you will learn to customize the default permission
 features.
 Log out of the user account and login to the admin account for now.
 Remember that you will use the admin email address and password to login,
 not the name.
 6.
 Create the recipe model.
 Next create a model using the hobo:resource generator, which will be called
 Recipe.
 It will contain three fields: title, body and country.
 We will complete this step by rerunning the Hobo migration from Step 3.
 This will take the model definitions and create a migration file and the
 database table recipes.
 
\backslash
one_table> hobo g resource recipe title:string body:text country:string
 This generator created a recipe.rb model from which the hobo:migration generator
 will create a migration file and a database table.
 Note: When we talk about a model’s name we are referring to its Ruby Class
 name that can be found at the top of the file.
 It also created the recipes_controller.rb controller, the recipes_helper.rb
 helper file, and recipes view folder.
 Run the hobo:migration generator: 
\backslash
one_table> hobo g migration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IMPORTANT: Hobo is different from Rails in that the migration file and database
 table are both the result of the hobo:migration generator.
 In Rails, generators typically create both models AND migration files but
 NOT database tables.
 Refresh your browser and you should see a Recipes tab added.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
7.
 Confirm your login info.
 Make sure you are logged in as the administrator.
 As long as you are logged in, you should see the “New Recipe” link on the
 left.
 Create three recipes and take care to add info in all three fields.
 You can create them either from the Home or Recipes tab.
 The finished recipes should be displayed in both the Home tab and the Recipes
 tab automatically.
 You can click on any of the names of the recipes to edit them.
 Try it out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 61: Page view of created recipes 8.
 Login as a user.
 Sign out of the admin account and sign in as another.
 Note that you can still see the recipe title.
 Now, you can click on the recipe title and view the entire recipe record
 but you cannot create or edit a recipe.
 This is governed by the Hobo “Permissions” module.
 In the next step, you will change the user permissions and see how the
 user interface responds by automatically providing creation and editing
 capabilities in the user interface.
 9.
 Edit permissions: Take a look at the recipe.rb model file.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
def destroy_permitted? acting_user.administrator? end
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
def view_permitted?(field) true end There are four methods that define the
 basic permission system: create_permitted?, update_permitted?, destroy_permitte
d? and view_permitted?.
 In exercising the permission system, you are editing Ruby code.
 The permission methods are defined within Hobo.
 Each method evaluates a boolean-valued variable (actually a method on an
 object) that indicates whether the named action is allowed or not allowed.
 Method Refers to permission to: create_permitted? create a record update_permit
ted? edit a record destroy_permitted? delete a record View_permitted?(field)
 view a record or field Figure 62: Table of Hobo permission methods For
 the code that is generated by the hobo:resource generator, the method is
 checking whether the acting user, which is the user that is signed on,
 is or is not the administrator.
 In practice though, the boolean value may ask another question or a more
 complex question.
 For example, one could write a line of Ruby code that determined if the
 signed on user was the admin AND the time was between 8:00 AM and 5:00
 PM.
 In other words, there can be other logical determinations but you have
 to know a little Ruby.
 acting_user method Meaning administrator? first user to sign up signed_up?
 any user who is signed up (including the administrator) guest? any user
 who is not signed up Figure 63: Table of Hobo "acting_user" options For
 these tutorials, we will use the acting_user object and its methods: administra
tor?, signed_up?, and guest?.
 Hobo encodes information about the user of its applications in the active_user
 object that determines if the user is an administrator, other signed up
 user or a guest user.
 For example, acting_user.administrator? equals ‘1’ if the user is the administra
tor and ‘0’ if the user is not.
 If we place it within the create_permitted? method, Hobo only permits users
 who are administrators to create database records related to the model
 containing the method.
 Note: The ‘?’ after signed up indicates the method is a Boolean method.
 The meaning of the default permissions code can be summarized simply now.
 Only the administrator is permitted to create, update or destroy records
 and anyone can view records.
 Using the view_permitted? method is a little more involved so we will wait
 until the intermediate tutorials to tell you about it.
 Before trying this out, it is useful to understand how Hobo implements
 these permissions within Hobo’s UI.
 Yes, Hobo not only provides the facility to set permissions but it also
 takes care of providing the right links and controls within the UI.
 When there is no create permission, there is no “Create a New {model_name}
 ” link.
 When there is no update permission, there is no edit link and no way to
 populate a form with an existing record.
 When there is no destroy permission, there is no “Remove this Record?”
 link.
 This will make more sense when you learn about controller actions in the
 next tutorial.
 Hobo permissions essentially turn controller actions (what users do in
 the UI) on or off depending on defined logical conditions.
 Let’s try something out now.
 As of now in your code, users who are not the admin can only view the records
 entered by the administrator.
 The user has no create, edit or delete permission; these options do not
 appear in the user interface.
 Now let’s make a minor change and see how the UI responds.
 CHANGE: def create_permitted? acting_user.administrator? end TO: def create_perm
itted? acting_user.signed_up? end Update your browser and you will see the
 New Recipe link appear at the bottom of both the Home and Recipes tabs.
 Now do the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CHANGE: def update_permitted? acting_user.administrator? end
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
def destroy_permitted? acting_user.administrator? end TO: def update_permitted?
 acting_user.signed_up? end
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
def destroy_permitted? acting_user.signed_up? end Click a recipe title.
 On the right hand side of the screen showing the record, you will see an
 Edit Recipe link now indicating editing permission.
 Click this edit link and you will now see a full editing page as well as
 a Remove This Recipe delete link in the upper right of the page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Try changing all of the signed_up? methods to guest and you will observe
 that you have full permissions even if you are not signed in.
 Complete the tutorial by putting back all three methods to signed_up?.
 Tutorial 5 – Controllers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Topics Introduce Hobo’s controller/routing system.
 Hobo automatic actions Show examples of the permission system working with
 controllers Tutorial Application: one_table 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steps 1.
 Demonstrate controller actions.
 Hobo has a set of built in actions for responding to user-initiated requests
 from browser actions (clicks).
 For example, when Hobo displayed the Recipes in Tutorial 3, it is the result
 of the index action found in the /app/controllers/recipes_controller.rb
 file.
 Open this file.
 Note: Recall that controller and model files contain Ruby code whereas
 view templates contain HTML with embedded Ruby code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
class RecipesController < ApplicationController hobo_model_controller
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
auto_actions :all end There is not much you can see--but there is a lot
 going on behind the scenes.
 The first line is similar to the first line of the Recipe model we told
 you about in Tutorial 1.
 It indicates that the RecipesController is part of the Rails ApplicationControl
ler and inherits general capabilities from this master controller.
 The next line, hobo_model_controller, tells Rails to use Hobo’s controller
 functionality to control the Recipe model and views.
 It is actually short for: #Do not copy - although it won’t change anything
 if you do.
 hobo_model_controller Recipe Hobo automatically infers the model name from
 the controller name in the first line above.
 Note: The pound (or “hash”) character (#) is the symbol to indicate a Ruby
 comment.
 Everything on a line following # will be ignored by Ruby.
 Code starts again on the next line.
 To create view template comments, where you are not in a Ruby file you
 must surround comments like this <!--Comment-->.
 The next line, auto_actions :all, makes all the standard actions available
 to the controller including: index (meaning “list”), show, new, create,
 edit, update, and destroy (meaning “delete”).
 If you are familiar with Rails, you will realize that Hobo has replaced
 quite a bit of Rails code in these two lines.
 2.
 Edit the auto_actions.
 Clicking the Recipes tab in your app invokes the index action of the Recipes
 controller.
 The index action of the controller tells Hobo to list the records of the
 model.
 You probably noticed this as you created new records.
 Each time you created a new one, you probably clicked on the tab to see
 a list of all the records you created.
 Now notice something else that you will learn to be important.
 When you click on the Recipes tab, the URL that is displayed in the URL
 window says: http://localhost:3000/recipes As you learn about the functions
 of the fundamental Hobo actions (listed in Step 1 above), you will learn
 that there is a unique URL entirely specified by the action and model name.
 Look at figure earlier in this book about “Actions and Routes”, and you
 will see the URL for an index action is the base URL, http://localhost:3000/
 concatenated with the plural of the model name, which in this case is “recipes”.
 We are going to further demonstrate that attempting to route to this URL
 invokes the index action by turning off the action in Hobo and then putting
 turning it back on.
 First go to your home page by clicking the Home tab.
 Then, in recipes_controller.rb, CHANGE: class RecipesController < ApplicationCon
troller
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model_controller 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
auto_actions :all
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
end TO: class RecipesController < ApplicationController
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model_controller 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
auto_actions :all, :except => :index
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
end The except clause in this code tells the controller to turn off the
 index action.
 Refresh your browser and you should see this display:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your Recipes tab disappeared.
 You can also try invoking the index action by typing http://localhost:3000/reci
pes into your URL window.
 You will get a blank page.
 Hobo will no longer invoke the index action because you told it not to
 in your code.
 Hobo decided to do more though; it changed the UI also.
 In Tutorial 3, you learned that Hobo figures out how your UI should look
 depending on your model code.
 There it changed what links were available depending on permissions you
 specified in the code.
 In this case, Hobo figures out how to change the UI depending on the controller
 code.
 Here it has removed a tab, the Recipes tab, because you disallowed the
 action that it would invoke.
 Now remove the except clause and you should get your Recipes tab back.
 Note: If you are new to Ruby you are probably noticing all the colons(:)
 and arrows (=>).
 For now.
 Think of these two as a way of connecting a Ruby symbol (any text that
 begins with a colon) to a value (the entity after the expression “=>”).
 We recommend a companion book such as Peter Cooper’s “Beginning Ruby: From
 Novice to Professional” to learn more about Ruby symbols and their importance.
 Now turn the index action back on by deleting the :except clause.
 class RecipesController < ApplicationController
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model_controller
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
auto_actions :all end 3.
 Remove and restore the new and show actions.
 Hobo allows you to edit this in two ways.
 You can either stipulate you want all except certain actions or that you
 want only specific actions.
 In other words, you can either indicate which actions you wish to include
 or indicate which actions you wish to exclude.
 The former is what you did in step three.
 Let’s try the latter where you declare which actions you want.
 The following code will do exactly what you did before but in a different
 way.
 First, use the following code to include all seven actions, including the
 index action.
 This code is equivalent to the auto_actions :all statement above.
 class RecipesController < ApplicationController
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model_controller 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
auto_actions :index, :show, :new, :create, :edit, :update, :destroy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
end Try removing the index action.
 When you save your code and refresh your browser, you will obtain the same
 result using the :except => index code.
 Now put back the index action and try removing the :new option.
 class RecipesController < ApplicationController
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model_controller 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
auto_actions :index, :show, :create, :edit, :update, :destroy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
end The result is that the New Recipe link to http://localhost:3000/recipes/new,
 the URL associated with the new action disappears.
 This is because you have disallowed the new action and Hobo takes care
 of cleaning up your UI for you.
 Even if you try to go to that URL by typing http://localhost:3000/recipes/new
 into the browser, Hobo tells you that you can no longer go there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Put the :new action back in and click the Recipes tab.
 Mouse over the Recipe links and note that the URL’s look like, http://localhost
:3000/recipes/2-omelette which are of the form http://localhost:3000/model(plura
l)/ID-model_name_variable which is the form that we discussed earlier in
 this tutorial for the show action.
 Note: Hobo assigns a name variable to the model equal to the value of the
 field it thinks is the most likely summary field.
 Hobo first looks for a field called name.
 Next it looks for the next most likely, which in this case it guesses is
 title.
 You can override the automatic name assignment by adding the option :name
 => true to the field you would like displayed as the “name”.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 67: How Hobo finds the default "name" attribute for a model You can
 also use a little “Hobo magic” to create your own version of name using
 a Ruby method as below:

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 68: Creating your own custom "name" attribute
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now back to our original train of thought…Remove the :show action.: class
 RecipesController < ApplicationController
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model_controller 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
auto_actions :index, :new, :create, :edit, :update, :destroy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
end Now when you refresh your browser you will note that you no longer have
 links to show(display) the details of a particular Recipe record.
 Even if you try to navigate your browser to http://localhost:3000/recipes/2-ome
lette, you will get an error.
 Now let’s try one more but using the except version of auto_actions again
 but first make sure you are back to the all actions state.
 Use the code below.
 class RecipesController < ApplicationController
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model_controller 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
auto_actions :all
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
end Navigate to the Recipes link where you should now see a list of hyperlinks
 to each recipe.
 Click on a recipe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Observe the Edit Recipe link on the right hand side of the display.
 Click or mouse over it to convince yourself that the URL associated with
 this link is: http://localhost:3000/recipes/6-hamburger/edit This is just
 the result you would expect for the edit action of the form: http://localhost:3
000/model(plural)/ID-model_name_variable/edit Now make sure you are on the
 screen above, a particular Recipe.
 Edit your code to remove the edit action.
 class RecipesController < ApplicationController hobo_model_controller auto_acti
ons :all, :except => :edit end Now you should see that Hobo removes the
 links to the edit action and even if you try to force Hobo to go to the
 above URL, it will not, giving you an error:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Remove multiple actions.
 So far we have showed you how to remove one action at a time.
 You can use the two methods we have showed you to remove two or more actions
 at a time.
 If you use the listing approach and you are starting with all the actions
 as in: class RecipesController < ApplicationController 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model_controller auto_actions :index, :show, :new, :create, :edit,
 :update, :destroy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
end If you want to remove both the new and the create actions, just delete
 them from your list so that you have: class RecipesController < ApplicationCont
roller
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model_controller 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
auto_actions :index, :show, :edit, :update, :destroy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
end If you start be specifying all actions and use the except clause, the
 equivalent code to the above will be: class RecipesController < ApplicationCont
roller
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model_controller 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
auto_actions :all, :except => [:new, :create]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
end
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: When removing the :new action, this actually adds a 'New' facility
 below the list of Recipes.
 When you remove the :show action, Hobo places an 'Edit' link against each
 listed item.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may be wondering why the :except option encloses the list of actions
 in square brackets and the listing approach does not.
 The Ruby :except method takes a Ruby array as an input and Ruby arrays
 are enclosed in square brackets.
 5.
 Using controller short cuts.
 There is one other way to add or remove controller actions and that is
 through the use of short cuts.
 The code: auto_actions :read_only is the same as: auto_actions :index,
 :show The code: auto_actions :write_only is the same as: auto_actions :create,
 :update, :destroy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: You can append actions or use the except actions clause with either
 of these short cuts.
 The proviso is that you must use the shortcut first and [use only one]
 and use the except clause last.

 Controller action summary Tutorial 6 – Navigation Tabs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tutorial provides an introduction to Hobo’s automatically generated
 tags.
 We will start with the navigation tabs that are generated for each mode.
 We will show you where to find them and how to make a simple edit to change
 how navigation tabs are displayed.
 We will explore this more deeply in Chapter 4.
 Topics Locate Rapid directories Edit the navigation tab Tutorial Application:
 one_table Steps 1.
 Find Hobo’s auto-generated tags.
 Open up the views directory and navigate to the rapid directory by following
 this tree: views/taglibs/auto/rapid.
 You will see three files called: pages.dryml, forms.dryml, and cards.dryml.
 It is here that Hobo keeps its default definition of the tags its uses
 to generate view templates.
 2.
 Open the pages.dryml.
 file.
 Take a quick look through this file and you will see tag definitions such
 as: <def tag="main-nav"> .
 .
 .
 <def tag="index-page" for="Recipe"> <def tag="new-page" for="Recipe"> <def
 tag="show-page" for="Recipe"> <def tag="edit-page" for="Recipe"> Notice
 how, except for the <main-nav> tag these correspond to the actions of Hobo
 Controller action summary above in Tutorial 5.
 You will further note that these are just the actions that require a view
 (remember index means list).
 The other actions, create, update, and destroy only needed a hyperlink.
 We are only mentioning this now to pique your curiosity for Chapter 4 where
 you will delve deeply into Hobo’s way of creating and editing view templates.
 3.
 Edit the <main-nav> tag.
 Copy the following code and paste it into your views/taglibs/application.dryml
 file.
 Hobo automatically uses code in this file instead of what it finds in pages.drym
l.
 In other words, application.dryml overrides pages.dryml and further makes
 it available to the entire application.
 <def tag="main-nav"> <navigation class="main-nav" merge-attrs param="default">
 <nav-item href="#{base_url}/">Home</nav-item> <nav-item with="&Recipe"><ht
 key="recipe.nav_item" count="100"><model-name-human count="100"/></ht></nav-item
> </navigation> </def> 5.
 Rename a Navigation Tab.
 By convention, Hobo names tabs, other than the Home tab with the plural
 of the model name.
 In this case, that is ‘Recipes’ Let’s try renaming this to ‘My Recipes’.
 There are a couple of ways to do this: Use Hobo’s i18n module to specify
 a new value for the recipe.nav_item key Override the main-nav tag in application.
dryml and rewrite it to specify ‘My Recipes’ as the Recipe tab label The
 preferred way of doing this is the first option and specify a new value
 for the recipe.nav_item key, the reason for this is that this maintains
 the application’s ability to handle multiple languages.
 If we overrode the main-nav tag in application.dryml, this would be a ‘hard-code
d’ solution and would always show ‘My Recipes’ regardless of the current
 locale/language.
 Just add the following to your config/locales/app.en.yml file: en: recipe:
 nav_item: "My Recipes" Refresh your browser and you will see a renamed
 tab:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 Remove the Home Tab.
 Instead of deleting the Home tab, just comment it out by surrounding it
 with <!-- ...-->.
 Note: Since view files are essentially HTML and not Ruby code, you use
 the HTML commenting syntax instead of the Ruby comment syntax.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
<def tag="main-nav"> <navigation class="main-nav" merge-attrs> <!--<nav-item
 href="#{base_url}/">Home</nav-item>--> <nav-item with="&Recipe"><ht key="recipe.
nav_item" count="100"><model-name-human count="100"/></ht></nav-item> </navigati
on> </def>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now refresh your browser and you will see the Home tab has been removed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
7.
 Reset the tabs.
 Since editing the application.dryml file will interfere with future tutorials,
 delete the code you copied above.

Tutorial 7 – Model Relationships: Part 1 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will learn how to create a new model that is related to another table.
 You will replace one of your table’s original fields with a key that is
 linked to a foreign key in order to select values.
 You will see how Hobo automatically creates a drop-down control to select
 values that you have entered.
 You will also make some controller action edits [and some permissions changes]
 to refine the user interface.
 More specifically, you will add a new model to hold the names of countries
 that a user will select from the New Recipe page.
 The application will identify the foreign key for that country and place
 it in the recipes table.
 Topics Model relationships Foreign keys Drop-down list boxes

Tutorial Application: one_table Steps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Copy the Application.
 If you would like to preserve your application in its state as of the end
 of Tutorial 6, you may wish to copy the application and work on the new
 version.
 Copy the entire application directory and paste it into a folder called
 two_table in your tutorials directory.
 To change the application name, make the following change to config/application.
rb: Figure 75: Changing the Application Name Shut down the web server by
 issuing a <control-c> in the command window where you issued the rails
 server command.
 Restart the web server and you are ready to go.
 
\backslash
two_table> rails server 2.
 Add drop down control for preset selections.
 This tutorial is about adding associations between tables.
 In subsequent steps, we are going to show you how to create a new Countries
 table to store the values of country names to associate with your recipes.
 Hobo will take care of the user interface rendering, as you will soon see.
 Before we do that though, let’s demonstrate the simpler approach.
 This is the easy way to go for applications when you know at design time
 all the possible values of a category.
 In this case, you would not need to add the additional complexity of creating
 a table to maintain all values for countries.
 All that is needed is to specify in the model the list of possible values
 using the enum_string attribute of a field.
 In this tutorial let’s assume the only values for country will be: American,
 French & Chinese.
 Your recipe.rb model code should now look like: class Recipe < ActiveRecord::Bas
e
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model # Don't put anything above this
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
fields do title :string body :text #country :string country enum_string(:America
n, :French, :Chinese) timestamps end We have used the enum_string field
 method to declare the possible values for country.
 So we can easily see what we have done, we have commented out the old version
 of the country field declaration by preceding it with a ‘#’ (hash).
 Now refresh your browser and click ‘New Recipe’ and you will see a drop-down
 control that lets you select values for country.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is fine as long as you don’t have to change the possible values.
 In the next steps, we will show you how to create a new table to store
 country values and be able to edit it on the fly and have it be reflected
 in your GUI.
 You will not have to write any queries.
 Hobo will take care of everything for you.
 3.
 Remove drop down control.
 First let’s get back to where we started before adding a new table.
 Edit your code to look like this.
 class Recipe < ActiveRecord::Base
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model # Don't put anything above this
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
fields do title :string body :text country :string #country enum_string(:America
n, :French, :Chinese) timestamps end
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The drop-down control will now be gone when you refresh your browser.
 Note: Remove the custom name attribute you created in the last tutorial
 before continuing.
 4.
 Creating model associations.
 In the next several steps, we will add a Country model, set up a relationship
 between the Country model and the recipe model and then run a Hobo migration
 to create the Countries table.
 This last step will also set up the foreign key in the Recipe model that
 will maintain the association to the index of the new Country model, country_id.
 When you look in the db/schema file to review the fields in your tables,
 you will not see the ID’s of any table listed but they are there.
 Every time you create a table using a migration in Hobo, it will also create
 the table index with a name defined by convention to be the model name
 with ‘_ID’ appended.
 5.
 Add a new model.
 We will use Hobo’s hobo:resource generator to create a new model with one
 field to store a country’s name.
 If you do not have a command prompt window open besides the window you
 used to start your web server, open a new one now and navigate to the root
 of the application.
 
\backslash
two_table> Execute the following command from your command prompt.
 
\backslash
two_table> hobo g resource country name:string Check the models directory
 and you should see a country.rb file with the following contents defining
 the Country name field.
 class Country < ActiveRecord::Base
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model # Don't put anything above this
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
fields do name :string timestamps end If you look in the db/schema file,
 however, you will not see a countries table because you have not run the
 migration yet.
 Let’s define our relationships now.
 The hobo:resource generator also created some other files.
 An important one is the controller file called countries_controller.rb.
 Note that the class names (how Hobo refers to them) are CountriesController
 for the controller and Country for the model, which you can see, in the
 first line of code in the respective files.
 Note: The controller has a file and class name that is the plural of the
 model name.
 The file names use underscores in the file names and removes them for class
 names.
 6.
 Remove a field.
 In preparation for setting up a relationship between the Recipe and Country
 models, you must delete the country field in the Recipe model.
 It will not be needed any more since it is replaced by the name field in
 the Country model.
 Open the recipe.rb model file and delete the country field from the fields…do
 block at the beginning of the file.
 So you can see what you have done, it would easiest to comment it out.
 Change this: … fields do title :string body :text # country enum_string
 (:American, :French, :Chinese) timestamps end … 7.
 Add a belongs_to relationship.
 The Recipe model will have what is called a belongs_to relationship with
 the new Country model.
 This relationship or association requires that every recipe have at the
 most one country associated with it.
 Add the belongs_to declaration just before the #permissions comment.
 Any belongs_to declarations must be added after the fields…do block.
 class Recipe < ActiveRecord::Base
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model # Don't put anything above this
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
fields do title :string body :text # country enum_string (:American, :French,
 :Chinese) timestamps end belongs_to :country 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
validates_presence_of :country …
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have also added validation so that the country is always specified for
 all recipes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: It is useful to read belongs_to as ‘refers to’ to remind yourself
 that when this relationship is declared, it causes the creation of a key
 field named country_id in the recipes table to “refer to” the country table,
 which contains the name field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the above belongs_to statement, :country is the name of a relationship.
 It is not the name of a field.
 Through its naming conventions, Hobo determines that the model to relate
 to is named Country.
 For the case when naming conventions fail, you can force the relationship
 as in the following code:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
belongs_to :country, :class_name=>"Some_other_model" 8.
 Add a has_many relationship.
 The Country model needs the inverse relationship to the belongs_to in the
 Recipe model:.
 class Country < ActiveRecord::Base
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model # Don't put anything above this
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
fields do name :string timestamps end has_many :recipes ...
 When you learn to do more sophisticated programming, this feature of naming
 relationships, which Hobo inherits from Rails, will become a powerful tool.
 Unlike standard relational database relationships, this capability essentially
 adds meaning to the relationship.
 9.
 Run the Hobo migration.
 Now you have done everything needed for Hobo’s intelligence to take over
 and create the new countries table and set up the proper foreign keys.
 Now, go to your command prompt and run the Hobo migration.
 By doing this you will allow Hobo to accomplish several things.
 Hobo will: Create the migration file for the new table, countries Remove
 the country field from the recipes table Set up a foreign key to handle
 the relationship between Recipe and Country Execute the migration to create
 the new database table, Countries.
 For every recipe record with a country entered, there will now be a country_id
 value written in the recipestable that corresponds to a country_id in a
 country record.
 
\backslash
two_table> hobo g migration You will get the following response: DROP or
 RENAME?: column recipes.country Rename choices: country_id Enter either
 'drop country' or one of the rename choices: Hobo has noticed that there
 is an ambiguity you have created that needs to be resolved.
 There is both a country field and a Country model.
 It knows you need a foreign key, country_id, to relate to the Countries
 table.
 So it gives you a choice to rename country to country_id or drop the country
 field and create a new country_id field.
 Since country has real country names in it, not foreign key integer values,
 it is best to drop it and let Hobo create a new field for the foreign key.
 Enter ‘drop country’ (without quotation marks) in response.
 Next the migration will respond as follows: What now: [g]enerate migration,
 generate and [m]igrate now or [c]ancel? You should type ‘m’.
 Last it will prompt you to name the migration file: Filename [hobo_migration_3]
: Just hit the ‘enter’ key and it will take the default name, hobo_migration_3.
 10.
 Review the results of your migration.
 Let’s take a look at the database schema in db/schema.rb: ActiveRecord::Schema.de
fine(:version => 20100313165708) do
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
add_index "users", ["state"], :name => "index_users_on_state"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
end
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: Hobo automatically creates appropriate indexes for table relationships
 with foreign keys.
 We will discuss how to enhance or disable this feature in a later tutorial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
11.
 Double-check the tab code before refreshing your browser.
 Back in Tutorial 6 #7, we asked you to delete the <navigation> tag.
 Go back there and make sure you completed that step before refreshing your
 browser.
 You should see a new tab for Countries.
 12.
 Review a few features of the UI.
 Make sure you are signed in as the admin.
 Go to the Countries tab and click through to enter a few countries.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then go to the Recipes tab and click through to edit one of your recipes.
 You should now see a drop down box just as you saw when you used the enum_strin
g option for your attribute:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The difference is that you are now actually selecting a country_id foreign
 key behind the scenes.
 Hobo takes care of querying the countries table (Country model) and displaying
 the actual country names.
 When you save this Recipe record, Hobo maintains all of the necessary related
 keys automatically.
 After you do the save, note that the Country value in the page is an active
 hyperlink: .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you click it, you will see a screen that allows you to edit the Country
 record.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can edit a country record because you are logged in as the “administrator”.
 If you check the countries.rb file, you will see that the permission to
 edit the Country field is limited to the administrator.
 This means that if you log in as a regular user, Hobo should not allow
 the edit.
 Log out from the administrator account and login as regular user.
 class Country < ActiveRecord::Base

 Now go to the Recipes tab, click on a recipe link and edit the recipe.
 Next click on the country name on the page.
 Now you see that the Edit Country link is no longer available.

12.
 One-to-many relationship discussion.
 The relationship or association that you have just implemented is known
 as a one-to-many relationship.
 In this particular situation, we have an individual country that is related
 to many recipes.
 More specifically, there is one record in the Countries table with the
 name ‘American,’ but potentially many American recipes.
 Tutorial 8 – Model Relationships: Part II
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this tutorial you will learn to implement many-to-many relationships.
 These relationships are useful, for example, in categorizing a model’s
 records.
 You will implement the relationship using the “has_many”, “has_many =>:through”
, and “belongs_to” relationship declarations of Rails.
 You will learn how Hobo establishes a direct relationship between model
 relationships and the features of the UI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of our tutorial application, you will be adding recipe categories
 so that you can categorize recipes as, for example sweet, sour, or hot.
 You will implement an architecture where it is easy to invert the relationships
 so that you can display both which categories a recipe belongs to and which
 recipes are classified in a particular category.

Tutorial Application: four_table Steps 1.
 Copy the Application.
 Just like you did in Tutorial 7, we suggest you copy your application from
 Tutorial 7 in order to easily go back to its state at the end of that tutorial.
 Shut down the web server by issuing a <Control-C> in the command window
 where you issued the rails server command.
 Then, do a copy in whatever operating system you are using.
 We have called the new application directory four_table.
 Navigate to the new directory.
 Restart the web server and you are ready to go.
 
\backslash
four_table> rails server You may wish to change the name of your application
 as displayed in the UI.
 Go to config/application.rb.
 Change the key config.hobo.app_name to read: config.hobo.app_name = "Four Table"
 Now refresh your browser and you will see the new name.
 2.
 Create the models.
 We are going to add two new models to our original application and keep
 the original Recipe and Country models.
 The first will be a Category model and the second will be a CategoryAssignment
 model.
 CategoryAssignment will have the two fields, category_id and recipe_id
 that correspond to keys of the same name in the Category and Recipe models.
 Note: If you review the schema in the app/db directory, you will not see
 these fields listed in the Categories and Recipes table.
 They are the default keys for these tables.
 Rails does not list them.
 As you will see shortly, you do not have to worry about creating or naming
 any of these fields, the Hobo generators will take care of it all for you.
 Go to your command prompt and issue the following two commands: 
\backslash
four_table> hobo g resource category name:string 
\backslash
four_table> hobo g model category_assignment The first command will create
 both a controller and model, Category being the name of the model.
 The second will create a CategoryAssignment model but no controller.
 When you implement the relationships below, you will see that CategoryAssignmen
t sits in between the Recipe and Category models.
 You do not need a CategoryAssignments controller because you will be accessing
 recipes and categories through these models directly and need no actions
 that pull data directly from the intermediary CategoryAssignment model.
 3.
 Add relationships to your models.
 Edit the models as shown below to enter model relationships.
 Note: Hobo migrations rely on both the field declarations in your models
 AND the relationship declarations.
 The relationship declarations allows Hobo to setup all the necessary keys
 to implement real model relationships.
 recipe.rb class Recipe < ActiveRecord::Base
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model # Don't put anything above this
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
fields do title :string body :text #country :string timestamps end belongs_to
 :country has_many :categories, :through => :category_assignments, :accessible
 => true has_many :category_assignments, :dependent => :destroy 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
category.rb class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model # Don't put anything above this
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
fields do name :string timestamps end
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
has_many :recipes, :through => :category_assignments has_many :category_assignme
nts, :dependent => :destroy category_assignment.rb class CategoryAssignment
 < ActiveRecord::Base
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model # Don't put anything above this
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
fields do timestamps end
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
belongs_to :category belongs_to :recipe 4.
 Discussion of model relationships.
 Note above that you used the has_many and the belongs_to relationships.
 You further used a has_many relationship with a :through option.
 Let’s start with the belongs_to relationship, which we used in Tutorial
 7 and declared in the CategoryAssignment model above.
 Recall that when you see belongs_to, think refers to, and you will understand
 that these declarations cause the category_id and recipe_id fields to be
 placed in the category_assignments table.
 The has_many :through statements instructs Hobo/Rails to setup the necessary
 functions to access a category from a recipe or a recipe from a category.
 The vanilla has_many statements set up the one to many relationships between
 the recipes table and the category_assignments tables and between the categorie
s and category_assignments tables.
 The :dependent => destroy option makes sure that when either a recipe or
 category is deleted that the corresponding records in the category_assignments
 table are removed automatically too.
 5.
 Run the hobo g migration.
 Go to your command prompt and run the following.
 
\backslash
four_table> hobo g migration Remember to respond ‘m’ when prompted for migration
 and just press <enter> when prompted with the migration file name.
 Note: At this point, if your web server is still running from earlier tutorials
, you need to terminate it and restart it.
 Rails and Hobo will not recognize a new database table without doing so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\backslash
four_table> rails server 6.
 Populate the new table.
 Open up your browser to http://localhost:3000/ and you should see the following
 (since you had copied over all the files from the Two Table application,
 your database came with you so you will not see the Register Administrator
 form):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now go to the new Categories tab and enter in some food categories:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
7.
 Adding new records to the relationships.
 Go to the Recipes tab.
 Click on one of the recipes and you should get this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice there is no category assignment.
 Then click Edit Recipe on the right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now you can see a new drop-down box that lets you add categories to your
 recipe.
 Hobo has taken care of this for you by inferring that you need it from
 your model relationship declarations.
 Note: Here is a good example of the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) notion
 playing out.
 If the necessary UI controls can be directly inferred from model structure,
 there should be no need to directly code it yourself.
 You may wish to use a different control but Hobo picks a reasonable one
 for you so you do not have to bother unless you want to.
 Take a look at the URL that activated the page.
 You will see that the URL is of the form for a “controller edit” action.
 If you need to remind yourself of the form look at the Hobo Controller
 Action Summary figure in Tutorial 5 step 6.
 Try adding a couple of categories and save the changes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, on the Edit Recipe screen, you can see that Hobo is displaying the
 entries for the Recipe categories you have chosen to associate with the
 recipe, namely hot and sour.
 So far, Hobo is doing just what we would expect.
 8.
 Add information to the model in order to display the associations.
 Hobo, before version 1.3, used ViewHints to indicate to the application
 how you would like to display related information on a model’s show page.
 To simplify things, this functionality has been moved into the model itself
 and ViewHints are no longer used as of Hobo 1.3.
 So now you modify the ActiveRecord model itself.
 Edit the app/models/recipe.rb file.
 Enter the code (in bold italics below) to tell Hobo explicitly to use categorie
s as the child of recipes in its displays.
 class Recipe < ActiveRecord::Base
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model # Don't put anything above this
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
fields do name :string body :text timestamps end
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
belongs_to :country has_many :categories, :through => :category_assignments,
 :accessible => true has_many :category_assignments, :dependent => :destroy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
children :categories
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[ ...
 ]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now edit country.rb:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
class Country < ActiveRecord::Base
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model # Don't put anything above this
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
fields do name :string timestamps end
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
has_many :recipes children :recipes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[ ...
 ]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now refresh your browser and choose a recipe to view:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you wish to see all the recipes, which are ‘hot’, you would click on
 ‘hot’ to check this out; or you could go to ‘Categories’ and then click
 on ‘hot’.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let’s enhance this view.
 Edit app/models/category.rb: Enter the code (in italics and bold below)
 to tell Hobo explicitly to use recipes as the child of categories in its
 displays.
 class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
hobo_model # Don't put anything above this
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
fields do name :string timestamps end
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
has_many :recipes, :through => :category_assignments has_many :category_assignme
nts, :dependent => :destroy children :recipes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[ ...
 ] Refresh your browser.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now you can see all of the “children” of the category “Hot” on the Category
 “show” page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
9.
 Comments on the many-to-many relationship.
 Now let’s review how you got this all to work.
 The end product is that you can see the categories associated with each
 recipe and the recipes associated with each category.
 In each case you can click through to look at individual categories or
 recipes and edit them if you wish.
 All of this is a result of having a recipe model related to a category_assignme
nt model, which is, in turn, related to the category, model and vice versa.
 We will call the category_assignment model the intermediary model and the
 other two, “outer” models.
 You have created a symmetrical set of model relationships where the two
 outer models have has_many relationships with the intermediary model and
 has_many :through relationships with each other.
 Conversely, the intermediary model has a belongs_to relationship with each
 of the outer models.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This structure will be used frequently in most data-rich applications.
 It is worth noting how you need only a few lines of code to implement this
 structure and how it lets you access each outer model from the other.
